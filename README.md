# Visualizing_the_Quality_of_Life

Project Overview:
This project aims to visualize the Quality of Life in various countries using data from the OECD Better Life Index. It involves creating interactive visualizations that are insightful, user-friendly, and suitable for both on-screen and printed forms.

Data Source:
The visualization is based on data from the OECD Better Life Index, covering 38 OECD countries and 3 non-OECD countries across 24 indicators in 11 topic areas.

Technologies Used:
- Python for data wrangling and visualization scripting.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Altair for creating interactive visualizations.
- Vega-Altair visualization library for rendering the charts.

Visualizations:
The project includes several types of visualizations:
- Bar Chart: Shows the life satisfaction score by country.
- Scatter Plot: Compares personal earnings with life satisfaction across countries.
- Line Chart with Trend Line: Visualizes the employment rate and self-reported health, including a trend line.
- Histogram: Represents the distribution of housing expenditure.
- Area Chart: Highlights the ratio of rooms per person by country.
- Combined Visualization: A concatenated visualization combining all the above charts into a single view.
